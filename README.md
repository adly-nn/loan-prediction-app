📦 Loan Approval Prediction App

A machine learning web application built with Streamlit to predict whether a loan application is likely to be approved based on applicant details. The backend is powered by Scikit-learn pipelines and tuned classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

📌 Features
📊 Preprocessing with ColumnTransformer and Pipelines

🔍 Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV

🧠 Multiple models compared: Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost

🌐 Streamlit app for interactive predictions

📁 Modular code for easy experimentation and extension

All models are built using Pipeline to ensure preprocessing is handled consistently during both training and prediction.

🛠️ Future Improvements
Use real financial data from open sources (e.g., CBN, World Bank)

Implement SMOTE or other techniques to handle class imbalance

Deploy as a REST API using FastAPI or Flask

Add model explainability with SHAP or LIME
